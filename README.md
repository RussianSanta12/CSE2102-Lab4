# CSE2102-Lab4

to start off Lab4 i git cloned the starter code we were given I then ran pip install flask for the server to run. after testing and understanding how the python server worked I coppied the ai generated factoring code and began to work on how I could get a user to input an integer into the server.  The def factors part of the my_server.py file which allowed an input of an integer with one of the curl commands. Then I began working on the test part of the lab I asked copilot to generate some test cases for my code and quickly realized that i wasnt getting the correct outputs that I was instructed to. So I then modified the trial_division function. First I set 1 as the first value in the list so it would always be included as a factor for a number then I created an edge case for when numbers are less than or equal to 1 to simply return that number and treat it like a prime and return
